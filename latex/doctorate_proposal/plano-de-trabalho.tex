           &t_{i,n+i} \leq r^k_i \leq L & (i \in P,~k\in K)\label{eq:max_ride_time}\\

           &x^{k}_{ij} \in \{0,1\}&(i,j \in V,~k\in K)\label{eq:boolean}
\end{align}

In this formulation, \(n\) is the number of requests (each request is a pair of a pickup and a delivery). If there's a pickup point \(i\); then the respective delivery point is \(i + n\) (i.e. each request is in the form \((i, i + n)\)). We have four location/point sets: \(P = \{1, \dots, n\}\) (the pickup points); \(D = \{n+1, \dots, 2n\}\) (the delivery points); the depot (points \(0\) and \(2n + 1\)); and \(V = \{0, \dots, 2n + 1\} \equiv P \cup D \cup \{0, 2n + 1\}\) (the universe set, i.e. all points). The depot is represented by two points only to simplify the model; it's expected to be the same point on space; the only difference is that we enforce each vehicle trip to start from \(0\) and end in \(2n+1\). We also have a vehicle set \(K\), as this a multi-vehicle variant; and we can distinguish between the capacity of each vehicle \(k \in K\) as \(Q_k\), (this is a heterogeneous fleet variant).

The remaining data given with the problem are: \(c^k_{ij}\) the cost of going from \(i\) to \(j\) with vehicle \(k\) (a byproduct of the distance and the vehicle model); \(t_{ij}\) is the time needed by any vehicle to go from point \(i\) to point \(j\) (we assume all vehicles travel at similar speed); \(d_i\) is the time needed to service (embark and disembark) the people at point \(i\) (this parameter can vary as some patients can have mobility problems and therefore need help from the driver); \(e_i\) and \(l_i\) define a time window for each point \(i\), a vehicle has to \emph{start} servicing point \(i\) after \(e_i\) and before \(l_i\) (but the vehicle don't need to finish attending the point inside the time window); \(q_i\) will be the amount of people that will embark (\(q_i\) is positive and \(i \in P\)) or disembark (\(q_i\) is negative and \(i \in D\)) at a point \(i\) (we expect \(q_i + q_{n+i}\) to be zero). Finally, \(T_k\) is the max trip time of a given vehicle \(k\), and \(L\) is the max ride time of any passenger.

The solution variable is \(x^k_{ij}\) \((k \in K,~i,j \in V)\). If the vehicle \(k\) goes from the point \(i\) to point \(j\) then \(x^k_{ij} = 1\); otherwise \(x^k_{ij} = 0\).

The following variables are used to model some of the constraints: \(u^k_j\) will be the time vehicle \(k\) begins to attend point \(j\); \(w^k_j\) will be the number of people inside vehicle \(k\) when it \emph{departs} from point \(j\) (i.e. after loading); \(r^k_i\) will be the time amount the passenger of pickup request \(i\) remained inside the vehicle \(k\) (his or her total ride time; from \(i\) to \(i + n\)).

The objective function \eqref{eq:objfun} is the minimization of the total cost of all trips. Constraints \eqref{eq:no_divide}, \eqref{eq:end_and_begin}, \eqref{eq:same_request_same_vehicle}, and \eqref{eq:no_bus_teleport} are flux constraints, where: \eqref{eq:no_divide} avoids that more than one vehicle visits the same point or that one vehicle leave a point by more than one single way; \eqref{eq:end_and_begin} guarantee vehicles start and end at the depot; \eqref{eq:same_request_same_vehicle} enforce that for the same request, the same vehicle will be used; \eqref{eq:no_bus_teleport} secure that a bus that arrived at point \(i\) will leave point \(i\) (at some moment). The times to start embark/disembark at each point are kept realistic by constraint \eqref{eq:travel_times}. Constraint \eqref{eq:capacity} guarantee a lower bound on the used capacity of each vehicle. The ride time of the passengers that embarked at \(i\) is defined by \eqref{eq:ride_time} (based on their embark/disembark times). The max duration of each vehicle trip is enforced by \eqref{eq:trip_time}. The time windows are respected because of constraint \eqref{eq:time_windows}; as the max ride is respected because of \eqref{eq:max_ride_time}. The constraint \eqref{eq:capacity2} helps constraint \eqref{eq:capacity} to guarantee that the vehicles capacity will not be exceeded. At least, but no less important, constraint \eqref{eq:boolean} defines that a vehicle can either use or not use a route (it can't partially use a route).

It's interesting to note that this formulation gives a maximum ride time for each passenger, even in the presence of time windows. This is a little redundant as time windows already enforce a max ride time specific for each passenger (and therefore much more reasonable than a fixed max time ride for all passengers).

\subsection{Literature review}


\section{Motivation}

THIS IS THE DOCTORATE PROPOSAL MOTIVATION
WORKS PROPOSE DIFFERENT OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS AND TEST WITH DIFFERENT INSTANCES
FOR A SINGLE PAPER THE EFFORT TO CREATE INTANCES EASILY ADAPTABLE FOR MANY VARIANTS; TO COMPARE MORE GENERIC METHODS TO MORE SPECIFIC ONES (heterogenuous fleet vs homogeneous fleet); TO GATHER INSTANCES ALREADY USED ON LITERATURE ON A TEST BED; AND TO CREATE QUALITY OF SERVICE METRICS THAT CAN BE USED TO COMPARE SOLUTIONS WITH DIFFERENT OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS; THIS IS IN THE SCOPE OF A DOCTORATE
	CREATE TABLE

\section{Objectives}

The objective to be pursued in the doctorate described by this proposal is: the creation of a framework that allows the comparison of the results of any techniques used to solve the multiple variants of the DARP (for exact and heuristic resolution); avoiding the proliferation of works that use the absence of a established testbed, or a minor difference on the DARP formulation, to justify absent or lax comparison.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Catalogue the most relevant DARP variants.
    \item Obtain or re-implement the codes used by the prior work to solve those variants.
    \item Propose a file format for the instance datasets, one that allows the same instance to be shared by many variants.
    \item Generate the instances used to benchmark the DARP variants (if based on a mathmatic model) on the literature.
    \item Obtain real world instances, already used at some time on the literature, or new.
    \item Make available all code and instances (on the proposed format).
    \item Gather and/or propose quality of service metrics to allow comparison between formulations with different objective functions.
    \item Benchmark the most relevant relevant exact/approximative/heuristic methods; and publish the results using the proposed quality metrics for comparison; to give a more clear notion of the state-of-the-art.
    \item If adequate, propose new methods for solving DARP to fill any gaps (or not much explored) techniques (as math-heuristics) and/or problem variants.
\end{itemize}

\section{Work Plan}

\subsection{Methods}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bibliographical research}: I intend to do a thoroughly literature review. The relevant articles will be discovered by means of Google Scholar and following selected articles references. The institute library and the Capes' Portal will not be excluded from this process. I will enroll on any courses offered by the doctorate program that can help to understand the problem and its solving methods. Articles that aren't available by the means of the partnership between the UFRGS and publishers (as Springer) will be asked directly to the authors.
\item \textbf{Real-world instances}: The research group of Dr. Buriol already has partnership with one vehicle routing company and one of her PhD students is working in scheduling problems within a hospital (hospital's DARPs are the source from the majority of the literature instances). While on the doctorate, I intend to make use of this to obtain new real world instances; and to verify if the academy can contribute back to the community on this topic (suggest the most adequate method for the hospital use; maybe write a case study paper). Also, if the sandwish doctorate is approved for the universities suggested on section \ref{sec:sandwish}, I will be placed inside the CIRRELT research group described on section \ref{sec:resgroups}. This group has partnership with many companies and the government, making easier to obtain real-world instances.
\item \textbf{Implementation and tests}: The Optimization and Algorithms group have servers that can be used to run the proposed benchmarks (that can take hours/days/weeks of CPU time). Any code that needs to be implemented, will be written in C++14 (or higher) and put on public domain. My experience with exact methods over NP-hard problems (master's topic), the algorithms and optimizations classes that I attended on master's, and the research group expertise on heuristic methods (over NP-hard problems) will contribute to the completion of the proposed doctoral work.
\item \textbf{Publishing}: The work will be published in conferences and journals relevant to the area, as described by in table \ref{tab:periodicosEconferencias}. If the chosen journals/conferences aren't open access; they will at least allow for for reusing the same content inside the PhD thesis, that will be open access and supersede any publications during doctorate.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Classes}\label{disciplinas}

The UFRGS's PhD program request from its students to take at least 18 credits, among other tests and activities, with the possibility of reusing the ones from master's. I plan to reuse the twelve credits from my master's (see table \ref{tab:AtividadesDot1}) and complete the requisites with the following classes/activities (see table \ref{tab:AtividadesDot2}). I can enroll in more classes if they show themselves relevant to the doctorate's theme (this will be reevaluated each semester).

\subsection{Classes and Activities Schedule}

The schedule below presents a first planning of the doctorate. This plan was made taking in account the following premises: 1) there's a PhD scholarship that begins at october of 2016, and this proposal is competing to receive it; 2) the author of this proposal will be allowed to finish his master's (using the the rest of 2016) to avoid losing the title and to allow the publication of results about his master's topic that are more recent than his last paper published. If this is not true, the semester of 2016/2 can be disregarded; the author will begin doctorate at 2017/1 and conclude it in seven semesters, using the eight semester only as a failsafe measure.

\section{Research Groups}
\label{sec:resgroups}

The \textit{Centre interuniversitaire de recherche sur les reseaux d'entreprise, la logistique et le transport}\footnote{Official site: https://www.cirrelt.ca/default.aspx} (CIRRELT, Interuniversitary research center on corporate networks, logistics and transport) is ``known as one of the top three places in the world working in logistics and transportation networks''\footnote{From the official presentation video available at: \url{https://youtu.be/f0lya0F1cUw?t=327}}. The focus on logistic and transport makes this research center to have many people and publications in the area of routing problems as PDVRP and DARP. Some of the researchers that are members of this group are: Gilbert Laporte; Jean-François Cordeau; Bernard Gendron; Julie Paquette. They have published 239 peer-reviewed papers in 2014 and 160 in 2015. The universities suggested for the sandwish doctorate, listed in the next section, are members of this research group.

\section{Sandwish doctorate suggestions}
\label{sec:sandwish}
This sections suggests two universities (and some advisors) for the planned sandwish doctorate. More options can be considered during doctorate if they show themselves relevant. The two suggested universities are located at Montréal, Québec, Canada\footnote{Montréal is a bilingual city with about 10\% of population only knowing english, and about 60\% knowing both english and french. Data from 2011 Census: \url{http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/vc-rv/index.cfm?Lang=ENG&VIEW=C&TOPIC_ID=4&CFORMAT=jpg&GEOCODE=462}.}. They are HEC Montréal\footnote{English version of official site: \url{http://www.hec.ca/en/}} and the University of Montréal\footnote{English version of the official site: \url{http://www.umontreal.ca/english/index.html}}. Both universities make part of the part of the CIRRELT research group cited last section.

Gilbert Laporte\footnote{See: \url{https://www.gerad.ca/en/people/114}} and Jean-François Cordeau\footnote{See: \url{https://www.gerad.ca/en/people/jean-francois-cordeau}}, that published one of the seminal works on DARP\cite{cordeau_dial_ride_2007}, work on HEC Montréal, and are my suggestions for advisor if HEC Montréal end up being my choice.

The University of Montréal is in the 113º position, by the THE World University Rankings 2016\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-of-montreal?ranking-dataset=133819}} while HEC Montréal appear nowhere in the same ranking. One suggestion of advisor for the University of Montréal would be Bernard Gendron\footnote{See: \url{http://www.recherche.umontreal.ca/en/research-at-udem/our-professors/profile/chercheur/157/pid/307/}} whose already advised works similar in theme\footnote{As \url{https://papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca/xmlui/handle/1866/13467}}.

In short, HEC Montréal has the best advisors, and the University of Montréal the best structure. As both are located on the same city, share a research group and, last year, Gilbert Laporte was a teacher at the University of Montréal, the best option would be the University of Montréal with Laporte as coadvisor.
