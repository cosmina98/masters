"This recognition occurs, however, only after extraneous computation." p. 1 ('extraneous' don't seem to fit the context, is this correct?) 

The code was implemented (codes/cpp/greenberg.hpp) and it shows a performance very similar to UKP5. I'm sure it's not the exactly same algorithm, many additional variables are used by the greenberg method, and both the 'i' and the 'f' vectors seem organized in different ways than the 'd' and 'g' ('i' is similar to 'd', and 'f' to 'g' but they aren't equal after different algorithms execution), but both are similar at other points, like the fact that it stores lower bounds forward instead of looking for subproblems backward, and have a built-in periodicity check (but the test iself is different too).
