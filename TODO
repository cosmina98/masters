* Add read_upk procedure to ruby too.
* Print n and c with the profile info.
* Test the sort variants using the run_per.out and test_per.out. Remember to remove hypertreading, isolate cpus and execute on distinct cores.
* Use tha above to Compare performance of XOR swap with generic template swap.
* Debug CHECK_PERIODICITY_FAST. It's segfaulting with big instances (/data/sukp/big_instances/).
* Comment the code more. Take one day to comment every tricky bit.
* Consider the possibility of not initializing all the g and d vectors at first, but only reserve the necessary memory, and resize it as is necessary. The profiling shows that the vector initialization is dominant on some instances when periodicity is activated, and also that sometimes only a fraction of that vector is used.
